# State files

raioz writes five categories of state. Each has its own ADR, but
nothing single said "here are the files, here's what each one is
for, here's who writes and deletes them." This page is that
matrix. Companion to [LOCKS.md](LOCKS.md) (the serialization
companion) — between the two you can answer "where does this go
and how is it protected" in 30 seconds.

## At a glance

| File | Path | Scope | Purpose | ADR |
|------|------|-------|---------|-----|
| `.raioz.state.json` (LocalState) | `<project>/` (project cwd) | per-project, per-cwd | Runtime overrides Docker can't tell us: host PIDs, dev-mode swaps, ignored services, sibling deferrals, compose path | ADR-011 (origin) |
| `raioz.root.json` | `<RaiozStateDir>/workspaces/<project>/` | per-project | Drift-detection snapshot of the resolved `Deps` after most recent `up` | ADR-023 |
| `audit.log` (+ `.1` rotation tail) | `<RaiozStateDir>/` | per-machine, append-only JSONL | Forensic history of lifecycle / dev / sibling / drift events | ADR-020, ADR-022, ADR-027 |
| `routes/<project>.json` | `<WorkspaceProxyDir>/routes/` | per-project per-workspace | Persisted proxy route entries; merged into the workspace's `Caddyfile` | ADR-005 |
| `shared-deps.json` | `<RaiozStateDir>/` | per-machine, keyed by workspace→dep | Refcount of which projects consume each shared dependency; gates last-consumer teardown | ADR-050 |
| `cert.pem` + `cert-key.pem` | `~/.raioz/certs/<domain>/` | per-domain (machine) | mkcert-issued local TLS cert + private key | ADR-003 |

Plus transient artifacts (not "state" in the sense of "raioz
reads it later"):

- `<WorkspaceProxyDir>/Caddyfile` — regenerated from
  `routes/*.json` on every `Reload` (ADR-005).
- `<RaiozStateDir>/<workspace>/` — proxy-managed assets per
  workspace (Caddy mount points, generated configs).

```

`naming.RaiozStateDir()` resolves to (in order): `RAIOZ_HOME` →
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/raioz` → `~/.local/state/raioz` (ADR-022).
`WorkspaceProxyDir()` returns `<RaiozStateDir>/<workspace>/` for
workspace-shared mode (ADR-005). The cert dir sits at the
legacy `~/.raioz/certs/` and is not migrated; the migrator
moves runtime state, not crypto material. See "Open question"
below.

## Quién escribe qué

| File | Writer | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
| LocalState | `internal/state/project_state.go::SaveLocalState` | `raioz up` (after dispatch), `raioz dev` (promote/revert), `raioz ignore` |
| `raioz.root.json` | `internal/root/root.go::Save` | `raioz up` (`upcase.saveState`) — once per up, after services + infra are tracked |
| `audit.log` | `internal/audit/audit.go::Log` / `LogWithContext` | every event in the OBSERVABILITY.md matrix that's currently emitted (lifecycle up/down/restart, dev promote/revert, sibling deferred, drift, conflict resolved, service assisted) |
| `routes/<project>.json` | `internal/proxy/routes_persist.go::SaveProjectRoutes` | `raioz up`'s `startProxy` after `AddRoute` for every service |
| `shared-deps.json` | `internal/refcount/refcount.go::AddRef` | `raioz up`'s `registerSharedDepRefs` — one ref per dispatched shared dep |
| `Caddyfile` | `internal/proxy/caddyfile.go::generateCaddyfile` | indirect — every `Reload` and the first `Start` |
| certs | `internal/proxy/certs.go::EnsureCerts` | proxy `Start` when `tlsMode == mkcert` and the SAN-validated cert is missing |

## Quién borra qué

| File | Deleter | Trigger | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| LocalState | `internal/state/project_state.go::RemoveLocalState` | `raioz down` (orchestrated path) when `localState.Project == ""` (orphan from old binary); otherwise the file is rewritten with `HostPIDs` cleared so subsequent reads see "not running" | Selective `raioz down <svc>` does NOT remove the file — other services may still be tracked |
| `raioz.root.json` | `internal/root/root.go::Delete` | `raioz down` (orchestrated) when `len(leftovers) == 0` per ADR-023 | Selective down does NOT delete it (only a subset was torn down) |
| `audit.log` | `internal/audit/audit.go::rotateIfOverCap` | size > 10 MiB → renamed to `audit.log.1` (overwriting any prior `.1`) | Never deleted outright; tail is recoverable |
| `routes/<project>.json` | `internal/proxy/routes_persist.go::RemoveProjectRoutes` | `raioz down`'s `stopProxy` | Last project out of the workspace also stops the Caddy container itself (ADR-005) |
| `shared-deps.json` | `internal/refcount/refcount.go::DropRef` / `Reconcile` (`save` removes the file when empty) | `raioz down` drops the leaving project's refs; the file is deleted once no workspace has any ref left | A shared dep is torn down only when its ref set empties (ADR-050) |
| `Caddyfile` | regenerated, not deleted | every `Reload` — old content overwritten | If the last project leaves the workspace the file remains until the workspace dir is cleaned manually |
| certs | manual (`rm -rf ~/.raioz/certs/<domain>`) | n/a — raioz never deletes user-trusted CAs | Per-domain isolation makes manual cleanup safe (ADR-003) |

## LocalState vs raioz.root.json — the project-scoped split

The two files are the most common confusion point: both live
per-project, both get cleaned at down. They are conceptually
different:

| Concern | LocalState (`.raioz.state.json`) | `raioz.root.json` |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Where | next to the user's `raioz.yaml` | under `<RaiozStateDir>/workspaces/<project>/` |
| Survives `cd elsewhere && raioz logs` | No — file is per cwd | Yes — central state dir |
| Read at | every command that needs PIDs or override flags | next `up` only, for drift detection |
| Mutated during | dispatcher start/stop, dev promote, ignore add/remove | `upcase.saveState` (one write per up) |
| Schema | runtime overrides (PIDs, dev swaps, deferred siblings, compose path) | full resolved `Deps` snapshot (services, infra, env, metadata) |
| What it answers | "what did the previous `up` actually start, and where?" | "did the YAML change since last `up`?" |

**Heuristic:** if the new info changes per-up (PIDs, dispatch
results, sibling defer decisions), it's LocalState. If it's a
post-resolution snapshot of `raioz.yaml`, it's `raioz.root.json`.

## Adding a new state file

1. Pick its scope and put it on the right axis. Per-project
   transient → LocalState (extend the struct). Per-project
   snapshot → `raioz.root.json` (extend `RootConfig`). Per-machine
   forensic → `audit.log` (new `EventType`).
2. **State files mirror reality** — ADR-023. Anything you
   write must have a paired delete on `down`. Same rule:
   selective down skips, full down deletes.
3. Put the path under `naming.RaiozStateDir()` (ADR-022) so it
   participates in the unified migration. Avoid hardcoding
   `~/.raioz/...` for new state (the cert dir is the
   grandfathered exception).
4. If the file is workspace-scoped (shared across projects in
   one workspace), put it under `WorkspaceProxyDir()` or a
   parallel `<RaiozStateDir>/<workspace>/` subdir.
5. Update this page (`docs/STATE.md`) and CLAUDE.md's invariants
   list if the new file establishes a new scope.
6. If concurrent processes can write to it, see
   [LOCKS.md](LOCKS.md) for the lock-hierarchy rules.

## Cert location: `~/.raioz/certs/` (intentional exception)

`internal/proxy/certs.go::CertsDir()` returns
`<home>/.raioz/certs/`. The migrator (`MigrateLegacyStateDirs`)
intentionally does NOT lift this directory into `RaiozStateDir()`.
Decided in [ADR-042](decisions/042-certs-stay-at-home-raioz.md):
TLS certs are tool-managed (mkcert) artifacts co-located with
their CA root in `$HOME`, not raioz-owned runtime state. ADR-022's
"single source of truth" applies to raioz-owned state; certs are
out of scope by design.
